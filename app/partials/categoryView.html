In this ever-changing situation, IBVI is closely monitoring and adhering to the recommendations provided by experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Office of Personnel Management.</a></p>
        <p>Rest assured, NSG Customer Service and distribution center are both running as normal and all orders placed are shipping as normal. The challenges we could potentially face soon are replenishing our items that are out of stock. Most of our partnered manufacturing facilities are operating but that could change in a moment’s notice. We will do our best to keep you informed in the event anything changes. If you need to update the shipping address on a current order, or for any further questions or concerns, please get in touch with us by calling between the hours of 8a-6p EST, Monday-Friday, at 1.855.444.0847 or send us an email at <a href="mailto:service@nationalservicegear.org?subject=NSG%20COVID-19%20Inquiry">service@nationalservicegear.org</a>.

        <h4>If you just happened to come across this category you will notice that there are no options below. This category is intended for our customers that make reorders of their organization's set uniform items. We create a category for your volunteer organization and in that category we add items that you need to reorder. We then assign that category to the respective customers so only the people that need the items can purchase and see the items. So, instead of contacting us for a quote each time we'll just let you log in, go to your program's category, select your gear and voilà, your custom gear will arrive in 10-15 business days. If this sounds like something you and your organization would like to take advantage of, please let us know by <a href="mailto:service@nationalservicegear.org?subject=NSG%20Made-To-Order%20Program%20Question">clicking here and sending us an email</a> with your questions.</h4>
