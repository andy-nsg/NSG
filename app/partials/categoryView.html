This category is intended for our customers that make reorders of their organization's set uniform items. We create a category for your volunteer organization and in that category we add items that you need to reorder. We then assign that category to the respective customers so only the people that need the items can purchase and see the items. So, instead of contacting us for a quote each time we'll just let you log in, go to your program's category, select your gear and voilà, your custom gear will arrive in 10-15 business days.
