        <h4><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> A Note on AmeriCorps Inventory</h4>
        <p>Due to the evolving landscape of the AmeriCorps program, we are transitioning many items that were previously "Stock" into a <strong>Made-To-Order (MTO)</strong> model. This ensures a wider variety of gear remains available for your programs year-round.</p>

        <h4><i class="fa fa-university"></i> National Park Service Inventory</h4>

        <h4><i class="fa fa-tag"></i> Made-To-Order Program</h4>
        <p>To provide you with the greatest selection of garments and customization options, this store operates on a <strong>Made-To-Order (MTO)</strong> model. We do not maintain a pre-printed "shelf" stock; instead, each item is crafted specifically for your order.</p>
